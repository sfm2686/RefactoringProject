This is the RIT SWEN 262 Refactoring Project. The original project contains a java application that allows for the management of a bowling alley. Within the application, a collection of lanes can be monitored through a control desk, parties of bowlers can be assigned to the lane, the configuration of the pinsetter can be viewed, and the bowler's scores can be printed at the completion of the game. This original source materials contains designs, code, and documentation that exhibits poor software engineering design principles as well as anti-patterns. 

Our purpose was to improve the designs and source code of this application. Metrics were gathered for the project, and along with visual code and documentation inspection potential areas for refactoring were determined. Our progress was broken up into refactoring iterations, as can be seen in individual directory. 

To run the program, ensure that your machine has the lastest version of Java installed and follow the following steps:
	
	1. Download the entire repository. 
	2. Navigate to RefactoringProject/deliverable/jar
	3. If on a command line, run the command 'java -jar refactor.jar'.
	4. Otherwise simply double click on the file which will run the program.
