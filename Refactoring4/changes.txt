Merged the progress from Refactoring3 and RefactoringAlgo together.

Added a publish() call in Lane once it is determine the game is finished. This allows the GUI to finalize the score display one last time.

In Lane, removed the unused getters.

Added the ScoreCalculator class and migrated all of the getScore functionality originally belonging to main into that class.
