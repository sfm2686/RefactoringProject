There were GUI components that were arbitrary observers of the Pinsetter so the subscribe methods were removed.

In Lane, got rid of the recievePinsetterEvent method and added the standard Observer.update method.
	We decided to keep the PinsetterEvent since it encapsulates data not inherit to Pinsetter. 
	
Changed the constructor of the PinSetterView.java class to accept a Pinsetter so that is has
the responsibility of adding itself as an observer.

Removed the PinsetterObserver class.

Replaced the extend Thread call in Lane to an implements Runnable. Then in the constructor
we created a new thread object, passing itself (as a Runnable object) as a parameter), 
and then started it. This effectively allows for us to extend the Observable class in Lane
now.

Deleted the redundant lanePublish() method within Lane.java
Replaced the publish() method with the proper Observable notify operations within Lane.java.
