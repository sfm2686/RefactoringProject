Changed the class visibility of BowlerFile.java and ControlDesk.java so that the 
GUI components would have access to them being from a different package.

Moved all of the View/Control elements of the program to a new ViewControl package.
Moved all of the Model elements of the program to a new Model package.

TODO: The Lane.java file has some GUI elements in it that need migrated to the correct classes.
