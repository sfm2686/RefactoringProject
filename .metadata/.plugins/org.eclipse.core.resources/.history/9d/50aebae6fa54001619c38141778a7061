There were GUI components that were arbitrary observers of the Pinsetter so the subscribe methods were removed.

In Lane, got rid of the recievePinsetterEvent method and added the standard Observer.update method.
	We decided to keep the PinsetterEvent since it encapsulates data not inherit to Pinsetter. 
	
Changed the constructor of the PinSetterView.java class to accept a Pinsetter so that is has
the responsibility of adding itself as an observer.
