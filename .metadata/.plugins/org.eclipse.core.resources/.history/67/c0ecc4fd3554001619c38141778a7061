Changed the class visibility of BowlerFile.java and ControlDesk.java so that the 
GUI components would have access to them being from a different package.

Moved all of the View/Control elements of the program to a new ViewControl package.
Moved all of the Model elements of the program to a new Model package.

TODO: The Lane.java file has some GUI code in it that needs migrated to the correct classes.
	Set the resetScores and resetBowlerIterator methods to public to allow GUI control.
	Added a few getters within Lane so that LaneStatusView is able to generate the end-of-game routine orginally found in Lane
	Transfered the end-of-game code in Lane to LaneStatusView, decoupling the Model from the GUI
