Changed the class visibility of BowlerFile.java and ControlDesk.java so that the 
GUI components would have access to them being from a different package.

Moved all of the View/Control elements of the program to a new ViewControl package.
Moved all of the Model elements of the program to a new Model package.

The Lane.java file had some GUI code in it that needed migrating to the correct classes.
	Set the resetScores and resetBowlerIterator methods to public to allow GUI control.
	Added a few getters within Lane so that LaneStatusView is able to generate the end-of-game routine originally found in Lane.
	Transfered the end-of-game code in Lane to LaneStatusView, decoupling the Model from the GUI.
	
Note: Eclipse not allowing program to be run correctly. Runs fine from the command line though.
